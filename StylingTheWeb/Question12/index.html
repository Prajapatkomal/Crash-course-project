     <p class="highlight">Punctuality is the characteristic of completing a required task or<br/>
      fulfilling an obligation before or at a previously designated time based<br/>
      on job requirements and or daily operations."Punctual" is often used<br/>
      synonymously with "on time". An opposite characteristic is tardiness.Each<br/>
      culture tends to have its own understanding about what is considered an<br/>
      acceptable degree of punctuality.[2] Typically, a small amount of lateness<br/>
      is acceptable—this is commonly about five to ten minutes in most Western<br/>
      cultures—but this is context-dependent, for example it might not the case<br/>
      for doctor's appointments.</p> 
       

      <p class="note">  Discipline is the self-control that is gained by requiring that rules or<br/>
      orders be obeyed, and the ability to keep working at something that is<br/>
      difficult.Disciplinarians believe that such self-control is of the utmost<br/>
      importance and enforce a set of rules that aim to develop such behavior.<br/>
      Such enforcement is sometimes based on punishment, although there is a<br/>
      clear difference between the two. One way to convey such differences is<br/>
      through the root meaning of each word: discipline means "to teach", while<br/>
      punishment means "to correct or cause pain". Punishment may extinguish<br/>
      unwanted behavior in the moment, but is ineffective long-term; discipline,<br/>
      by contrast, includes the process of training self control.</p>
