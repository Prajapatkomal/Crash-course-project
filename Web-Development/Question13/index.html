      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am from Bhiwandi (Maharastra).I am a postgraduate in Chemistry with a
        deep curiosity for technology and a strong drive to transition into the
        world of web development. Over time, Iâ€™ve discovered a real passion for
        building websites and applications, which has led me to pursue
        full-stack development seriously. I'm currently learning and practicing
        technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like
        React and Node.js. With a strong foundation in analytical thinking from
        my science background, I bring a detail-oriented mindset and
        problem-solving skills to everything I do. My dream is to become a
        full-stack developer at a leading company, where I can grow, innovate,
        and contribute to meaningful projects.
